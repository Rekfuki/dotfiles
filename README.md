### My dotfiles

__Installation:__

> Note: Remember to backup your current dotfiles and ~/.vim folder

If you already have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed, you can run the following commands in your prompt:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/georgijd/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
make
```
In case you don't have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed, just download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/georgijd/dotfiles/archive/master.zip) for this project and unzip it to ~/dotfiles. Then:
```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
make
```
